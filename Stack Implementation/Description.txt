Implement a stack inteface for integers.
Supported functions: 'push' and 'pop'

The code will ‘push’ a series of integers and then ‘pop’ and print every alternate integer.

The input file path is provided as the first argument. 
Each line is tested and the results are printed (e.g. alternate integers)
